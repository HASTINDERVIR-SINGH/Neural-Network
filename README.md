# Neural Network Project
Neural Network respository

In this repository I have shared on some of the things and projects I have worked on, these are all focued around the CNN (Convutional Neural Network) and its different
varaition used by everyone in general.




# Abstract
This notebook contains the code that identify and differntiate the clothing picutre in fashion mnist dataset. The dataset contain of 70,000 black and white images, which are in 28*28 grayscale image format, associated with a label from different 20 classes.

In the code below we are going to use CNNs to identify and correctly predict the images class along with it's scategory. The observation are both visual and statistical are made before models, to understand more about the data. A variety of histogram and scatter plot are made.

Hence the data is prepared differently for each model. The first 2 model are CNN but they have different model layer and droup out and the third DCSCAN is used for creating fake batch so that if their is any need to share the data some fake images are present. Out of the two cnn model the second model is better in predicting images along with its predictibility.

The  dataset and the code is helpful for identifying for fashion category so that it can be used in online shop for adding new styles in category for  shop or identifying the shirt and other clothes which are present online.
